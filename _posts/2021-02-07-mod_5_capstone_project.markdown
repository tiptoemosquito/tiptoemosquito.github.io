 Wow! This has been a stressful one, and very challenging but I am glad I was able to accomplish it! This entire program has come down to this project, which tested everything I know. Putting this application together was a trying experience and definitely had its hair pulling moments. My biggest struggle with this particular application was the frontend aspects, I am still trying to grasp what exactly is going on. All in all I think I can say that this project helped me prepare for what would be expected of me in the real world of Software Engineering and I couldn't be more excited about it!
