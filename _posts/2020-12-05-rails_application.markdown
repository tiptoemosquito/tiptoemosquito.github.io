Project three already!? It feels like we have only just begun, the amount that my brain has retained over the last three months is insane and I couldn't be more proud of myself. This project was a lot more enjoyable to complete and I think that has a lot to do with what was learned in Sinatra a.k.a "stRESTful routes".* Yikes.* However, I can honestly say that I now have a better understanding of how routes work. 

So getting started on my application was a little hectic due to my lack of reading, whoops, but after creating another repository and using the devise gem things started to go a lot smoother. 

*Quick note: The devise gem is seriously magic and I couldn't be more grateful for it.*

Moving on, so after getting the basics out of the way, I had to start checking off my list of project requirements which went just fine, only a few hiccuos here and there. Towards the end of the project I had a somewhat functioning app that I happily showed off to people who had absolutely no idea what I am doing but still totally supportive! 
Once I got all of my bugs worked out and finally had a working rails application, I decided to try a bit of styling and instantly fell in love with bootstrap, seriosuly where has this been all of my coding life?? 

With the help of my cohort lead, friends and google, I was able to create an app I am truly proud of and can't wait to see what's in store with JavaScript!
