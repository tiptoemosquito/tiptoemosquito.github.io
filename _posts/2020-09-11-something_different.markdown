In a year full of change and reflection, 2020 gave me a chance to really think about what would make me feel, I don't know, happier I guess?I had gone down more career paths than I would like to admit but nothing ever got my gears moving. At one point, I thought I wanted ot be a nurse and then realized all too quickly I couldn't handle the icky side of that at all! In another former life, I was certain to be the next best selling author, going on book tours and being a featured guest on *Good Morning America*. Turns out writing a book is a lot harder than it looks, I am still suffering from writers block. 
Over the years I continued to have a hard time connecting to one hobby, one career path, and if I'm being honest, really just anything. I will say for certain that there has been one thing that has always been a constant in my life and it's been technology and computer sciences. The only question I had was, can I even do this? I honestly never thought I was "smart" enough to grasp what coding was all about, but after researching and looking into everything it encompassed I made the decision to try it out! 
I had always been fascinated by puzzles and problem solving, so coding seemed like the biggest puzzel of my life! I couldn't wait to learn as much as my brain could handle, so I devoured all of the youtube videos, articles and blog posts I could find about coding, software egineering and data science just to scratch this itch. Finally after some self evaluation and *one or more nights of pep talks*, I started my research into the best bootcamp programs that could be completed online.
After getting accepted at Flatiron, my excitement to learn and actually get to coding grew. For once I felt like I had found my passion, as cheesy as that may sound, and I was to go for it with full force!
I had never felt the drive others had in their professions and figured I was just someone who didn't like anything, but now I can say I have found what will keep me motivated to move forward.
