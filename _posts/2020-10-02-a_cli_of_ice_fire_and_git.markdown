I did it! I really did it! Honestly still in shock that I finished this preoject with *some* of my sanity left. This was definitely a test of my mental strength, as I have not had to do a project for school in quite some time. *SSSSHHHHHHhhhhh*... don't tell anyone, but I'm kind of old. ðŸ˜¬
	
Anyway, back to the topic at hand, my CLI. I had a completely different plan going into this project, a grand plan in fact! I was going to create a CLI that would create a drink from your selections, but then tragedy struck when a drink API was used as a demonstration so I had to head to the drawing board and think of something else. I then decided I would create a CLI that showed you where/how you could vote depending on you state, great idea right? **WRONG!** I was stopped once again dead in my tracks by the dreaded API KEY! So again I lowered my head in saddness and panic because it was getting closer and closer to the projects due date and I still hadn't started.  Feeling a little down and sinking slowing into the swamp of despair, I went and took another look at the list of APIs provided by GitHub and found one that could work, a makeup API! Sounds like it would have been a winner, and it was at first...but I noticed something weird when trying to run my code so that it would consume the information from the API, nothing would happen. I spent a full two days freaking out that I was doing something wrong only to find out that the API was *ridiculously* slow, like glacially slow. So what did that mean for little ole me? Back to the drawing board you say? Well if you did, then you would be correct! 
	 
Thus brings us to my finished CLI, Ice and Fire! I had finally found:
	    A. An API that didn't need a key
			B. An API that didn't take hours to load
			and..
			C. A topic that really meant something to me! 
			
I couldn't have been more excited when I finally got everything up and running, everything was loading quickly and running smoothly. I felt so confident writing my code and watching it work seemlesly, it was really a "Wow I can do this" moment! I felt like everything I learned so far was finally making sense in my brain and that I was able to put this new knowledge into use. I am so overly proud of myself, even if this is just the beginning of what I will learn!
