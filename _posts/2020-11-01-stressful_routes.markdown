Project two is done! This was deifnitly a test of my mental strength, but I feel so accomplised getting this project done. Thankfully this time around I was able to stick to one idea without having to change it mid week. *Hallelujah !*

I really needed to brush up on literally everything while tackling this one, but I think I am starting to get a better handle in what is doing what, and sending a response where and where it should be redirected. Well, at least I hope I do. *crosses fingers* 
My biggest truggle this week was definitely misspelliing something and then staring at my code for hours until showing my cohort lead and having her see the p[roblem in mere seconds. That was fun, but now I can say that I am absolutely finished and have started seriously spellchecking my code before testing it out. 

Going to certainly brush up some more on this while moving forward to the next module.
