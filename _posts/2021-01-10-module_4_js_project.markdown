Javascript has been a beast for me to understand, I was just starting to get the hang of backend and here comes a completely different logic and language for frontend. Starting this project was somewhat of challenge, with getting my frontend and backend to work perfectly together. Finally after having to redo my backend and frontend folders, I was able to move forward and get the rest of project started. The first couple of days of coding I had started to feel like I was understand JS perfectly but I was wrong by day 5, no worries though, my very helpful fellow cohorts helped out and I couldn't be happier about. All in all this was a very difficult project for me but I was able to get through it after watching countlesds Youtube videos and rewatching lectures from the previous weeks. On to the next now and then graduation, *hopefully*.
